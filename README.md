# Intention Repeater WiFi Broadcaster
The Intention Repeater WiFi Broadcaster broadcasts through Wifi your intention, repeatedly.
It is a standalone utility, based on ideas from the original Intention Repeater, but for WiFi.

The code was written for Windows. Linux would have different libraries for writing to WiFi.
